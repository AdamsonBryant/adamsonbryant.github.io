I am a PhD student in Economics at Brown University and a NIH T32 Fellow at the [Brown Population Studies and Training Center](https://pstc.brown.edu). My primary fields of interest are urban economics, applied econometrics, and labor economics. I am particularly interested in neighborhoods and applications of machine learning methods. 

I'm an avid runner who also enjoys spending time in the mountains. When I'm not outdoors, you can find me tearing out my hair watching Manchester United or consuming history books from any era or region.
